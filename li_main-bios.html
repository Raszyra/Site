            <h3>Lord Horatio Ironbark (Esq.)</h3>
            <p>Relatively young for a man of his status, Ironbark is nevertheless well-respected in his circles
               for his stalwart nature, bravery, wit and general good humor. 
                <br/><br/>
                Since his army days he prefers to wear
               a long, stylish traveling coat (navy blue) and can be identified in a crowd by his signature
                moustache, which is long enough to catch the wind on a blustery day.
                <br/><br/>
                Likes: Surprises, adventure, sigma behavior
                <br/>
                Dislikes: Pettiness, selfishness, sweets

            <h3>Alistair Shumacher</h3>
            <p>Once the humble and well-loved son of a German bank teller, Alistair was forced to reassess
               his values fighting in the trenches. His years in the war introduced in him something like 
               subtle misanthropy, and he quietly wonders if he should be more concerned. 
                <br/> <br/>  
                His skill with 
               a rifle or pistol is unmatched; an experimental training regimen put him well ahead of the pack.
                <br/><br/>
                Likes: Quiet afternoons, walks, puzzles
                <br/>
                Dislikes: Hubris, flighty emotions, snow

            <h3>Adelaide Shumacher</h3>
            <p>Somewhere inside, Adelaide is still the girl she was once, growing up simply in her small Cologne neighborhood; now, however,
               acting like that girl has begun to feel like a mask. She waits patiently to understand the immeasurable
               violence that infected her life and turned her into a name to scare greenhorned recruits - the Demon Maid Adelaide,
                Phantom Killer of the Rhine.
                <br/><br/>
                Likes: Nature, swordplay, fashion, her brother

                Dislikes: Complications, disrespect, money
